Microservice Design: The model was designed to run in a separate microservice. This architecture allows for better scalability, maintainability, and independence from other services. It also provides an abstraction that simplifies interaction with the model.

Model Training Triggering: The model training process is triggered when the user uploads data to the first microservice. This approach ensures that the model is trained with the most recent data and is ready to make accurate predictions.

Model Persistence: After training, the model is saved to disk using joblib. This enables the model to be reloaded when the microservice is restarted, eliminating the need to retrain the model every time the service starts.

Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing steps performed in the Jupyter notebook need to be replicated in the prediction microservice. This includes transforming the 'Country' feature using one-hot encoding, which needs to be done in the same way it was during training. This step is necessary because the model has learned from the encoded data, and any new data must be presented in the same format.

Country List Extraction: A list of all unique countries was extracted from the training data and stored. This list is used to transform the 'Country' feature of any new data that is passed to the model for prediction. The order of countries in this list must be consistent with the one used during training.

Predicting: When a prediction is requested, the input data ('Country' and 'Year') is transformed to match the format the model expects (one-hot encoded 'Country' and numerical 'Year'). The transformed data is then passed to the model's predict function to obtain the prediction.

Returning Predictions: The prediction (emission value) is returned to the user as a response from the microservice. This value can be used by the user or another service to make decisions or to be displayed in a user interface.
